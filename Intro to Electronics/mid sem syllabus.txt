Mid Sem Syllabus*:
1. RC, RL and RLC circuits: Filters (LPF, HPF and BPF)
2. Semiconductors and its theory: Intrintic, extrinsic, band diagram, doping and excess carriers
3. pn junction diodes: Simple and zener, doping, formation of depletion region, characteristic curves and operation
4. Diode Circuits: Rectifiers, filters, voltage regulators, clippers, clampers and logic gates
5. BJT: Structure/ construction, various characteristic curves and modes of operation (CB and CE)
6. BJT amplifier: Operation with q-point, switch, equivalent circuits and frequency response (gain and bandwidth)

* The topics mentioned herein are indicative. Study the related topics as well, as I am covering in the class. 

Pattern of questions: 60 marks; 2 hours
1. Numericals (~40 %)
2. Conceptual/ descriptive (~40 %)
3. Objective type (multiple choice and fill-ins) (~20 %)

Note: 
1. Follow the topics that I am teaching in the class (until mid-sem) very carefully, tutorial questions & solutions, and the hints that I am providing in the class.
2. Write your answers with adequate steps and clarity (step marking will be present), while considering the assigned marks. Assume suitable and valid parameters (if any) and justify clearly.
3. Organize your answers together. No fragmentation of sub-questions is allowed strictly.
4. Write in a clear/ legible hand-writing.
